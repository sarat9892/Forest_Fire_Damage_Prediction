# Machine Learning on Forest Fires Dataset

 - This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data.

## Process

### Regression

- Various regression models are implemented to estimate the area of forest fire burnt, using the predictor variables
- Models tested include, OLS, Ridge/Lasso Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Regressor
- Feature selection algorithms are also employed to pick the best predictor variables
