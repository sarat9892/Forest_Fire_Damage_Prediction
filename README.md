# Machine Learning on Forest Fires Dataset

 - This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data.
 - This was one of our assignments at uni and I was pretty clueless back then which reflected in my work.
 - Will try to do a much better job this time.
